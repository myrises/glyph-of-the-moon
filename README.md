[~~Description of creating this sigil~~](http://www.theomagica.com/the-glyphe-of-the-moon) :bangbang: broken link
```
The effect of the Glyph of the Moon can best be described in two ways:
Similar to other sigils it allows to create an astral fingerprint
or sympathetic sigil of the person to whom it is applied. 
However, this sigil is not based on the name of the person, 
but on the influences and forces of their natal chart.
Secondly - and more importantly in practice - 
it functions as an exponential charge of the subtle energies 
of that person or the talismanic structure it is applied to.

The Glyph of the Moon has also been described as a magickal power generator
or a 2D charing device. But whatever we call it, the results it allows 
to achieve are the best testament to its significant value for any practicing magician.
